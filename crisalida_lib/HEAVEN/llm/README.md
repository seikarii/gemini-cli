# LLM Module

This directory contains modules for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs), including connectors, client implementations, and specialized interfaces for different LLM providers or roles (e.g., Cerebellum LLM).

## Core Components

- `base_llm_connector.py`: Defines the abstract base class `BaseLLMConnector` for integrating LLM models.
- `cerebellum_connector.py`: A specialized connector for interacting with a low-level, tactical LLM (conceptualized as the "Cerebellum").
- `strategic_llm_connector.py`: A specialized connector for reasoning, planning, and high-level validation.
- `fallback_manager.py`: Manages situations where the main LLMs fail, allowing switching to alternative strategies.
- `independence_tracker.py`: An advanced monitor for tracking the autonomy and self-sufficiency of the LLM.
- `llm_disconnection_manager.py`: Manages the clean and robust disconnection of LLMs when the system achieves independence.
- `llm_gateway_orchestrator.py`: The main orchestrator for the brain-cerebellum interaction.
- `llm_health_monitor.py`: An advanced health and performance monitor for LLMs.
- `llm_metrics_collector.py`: An advanced monitor for LLM metrics and efficiency.
- `llm_migration_manager.py`: An advanced orchestrator for LLM transition and migration.
- `ollama_client.py`: An advanced client for integration with Ollama LLMs.

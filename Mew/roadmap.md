# MEW AGENT ROADMAP: FROM SKELETON TO GOLEM

This roadmap outlines the key development phases for the Mew Agent, building upon the foundational skeleton established during the initial architectural analysis.

## Phase 1: Core Agent Functionality (Current Focus)

**Goal:** Establish a basic, functional agent capable of learning and interacting with the Gemini LLM and the environment.

- **Implement `MentalLaby` (Memory Core):**
  - **Status:** MVP implemented. Needs refinement.
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Improve `createEmbedding` function for better semantic differentiation.
    - Enhance `recall` logic for multi-hop graph traversal and activation spreading.
    - Implement memory consolidation mechanisms (e.g., basic decay, reinforcement based on salience/usage).
- **Implement `BrainFallback` (Subconscious Learning Loop):**
  - **Status:** Skeleton defined in `MenteOmega`.
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Define `Film` and `FilmNode` structures (done).
    - Implement `learn_from_outcome` logic to update `Film` fitness based on action results.
    - Develop `_select_film` mechanism for `MenteOmega` to choose appropriate `Films` based on context.
    - Integrate `Film` execution with `ActionSystem`.
- **Implement `ActionSystem` (Execution Engine):**
  - **Status:** Skeleton defined. Basic tool execution implemented.
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Integrate with a real `ToolRegistry` (e.g., `packages/core/src/tools/tool-registry.ts`).
    - Implement robust error handling and structured output parsing for tool results.
    - Develop concurrent action execution (leveraging `max_concurrent_actions`).
- **Integrate `UnifiedPersistence`:**
  - **Status:** Full architecture defined and skeleton implemented.
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Ensure all core components (`MentalLaby`, `BrainFallback`'s `Films`, `MenteOmega`'s state) are correctly integrated with `UnifiedPersistence` for saving and loading.
- **Connect `MenteAlfa` (Gemini LLM):**
  - **Status:** Connection established in `GeminiAgent` and `MenteOmega`.
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Refine `getPlanFromMenteAlfa` in `MenteOmega` to parse more complex plans (e.g., JSON schema-based parsing).
    - Implement error recovery strategies for LLM calls (e.g., retries, fallback models).

## Phase 2: Advanced Cognitive Features (ADAM)

**Goal:** Enhance the agent's reasoning, meta-learning, and self-regulation capabilities.

- **Implement `JudgmentModule`:**
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Develop logic to process feedback from `ActionSystem` execution results.
    - Implement adaptive parameter adjustment for `MenteAlfa` and `MenteOmega` personalities.
    - Integrate with `EVA Memory` for historical performance analysis.
- **Implement `DualMind` Synthesis:**
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Develop sophisticated plan synthesis logic (combining `MenteAlfa`'s creativity and `MenteOmega`'s analysis).
    - Implement conflict resolution and dependency management for plan steps.
- **Implement `Attention` Mechanism:**
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Develop `MenteOmega`'s ability to select and prioritize relevant context from `MentalLaby` for LLM prompts.
    - Implement dynamic prompt generation based on current task and agent state.

## Phase 3: Emergent Intelligence (EDEN & LOGOS)

**Goal:** Explore non-symbolic and emergent forms of intelligence to unlock deeper insights and creativity.

- **Implement `LOGOS` (Symbolic Matrix VM):**
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Translate `DivineSymbols` and `PhysicsRules` into TypeScript.
    - Implement `SymbolicMatrixVM` and `Soliton` dynamics.
    - Integrate emergent patterns with `MentalLaby` and `MenteOmega`.
- **Implement `EDEN` (Qualia Manifold):**
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Translate `QualiaManifold` and `LivingSymbol` concepts into TypeScript.
    - Implement the physics engine for conceptual interactions.
    - Integrate subjective experience (`QualiaState`) with `ADAM`'s cognitive processes.

## Phase 4: User Interface & Visualization

**Goal:** Provide an intuitive and insightful interface for interacting with and observing the agent.

- **Interactive CLI:**
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Develop a custom CLI command (e.g., `/mew`) to launch and interact with the agent.
    - Implement real-time streaming of agent logs and status to the CLI.
- **External UI Window (Graphical Interface):**
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Design and implement a separate graphical application (e.g., web-based) for agent interaction.
    - Establish communication protocols between the CLI/agent and the external UI.
- **Internal State Visualization:**
  - **Remaining Prompts:**
    - Develop visualizations for the agent's internal thought process (e.g., `MentalLaby` graph, `Film` execution flow, `QualiaManifold` dynamics).
    - Display key agent metrics and state (e.g., `MenteOmega` personality parameters, `JudgmentModule` reports).

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as the project progresses and new insights emerge.
